               draft-wang-sidrops-fcbgp-framework-latest

Abstract

   This document descibes a security framework based on Forwarding
   Commitment BGP(FC-BGP).  FC serves as a versatile and extensible
   verification primitive, seamlessly integrating with existing hop-by-
   hop forwarding architectures, using a chain-based verification
   mechanism to ensure both end-to-end authenticity and operational
   validity across Autonomous Systems (ASes).By combining topological
   information and operational actions, FC-based framework provides a
   foundation for robust inter-domain routing and forwarding security.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet's routing and forwarding system relies on hop-by-hop
   mechanism to achieve global connectivity, providing significant
   scalability and flexibility.  However, this paradigm also introduces
   security challenges such as route hijacking and forwarding path
   manipulation.  The root cause lies in the mismatch between
   verification capabilities and information propagation range, which
   prevents end-to-end security while maintaining the flexibility of
   hop-by-hop processing.  Due to "indirect" nature of hop-by-hop
   mechanism, the authenticity and integrity of information cannot be
   verified.

   The existing representative mechanism BGPsec [RFC8205] aims to
   provide end-to-end verification by propagating onion-style signatures
   in BGP update messages.  Nevertheless, this design conflicts with
   Internet's distributed governance and hop-by-hop processing
   philosophy, resulting in substantial deployment hurdles.  Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480] is another key technology
   that reduces risk of route hijacking through cryptographic
   authentication of IP addresses and AS numbers, primarily by enabling
   Route Origin Validation (ROV).  However, RPKI mainly focuses on
   verifying route origins rather than path security.  Consequently,
   there is a lack of a unified and scalable verification mechanism.

   This document specifies a security framework based on Forwarding
   Commitment BGP(FC-BGP).  FC is a cryptographic signature code
   employed to validate an AS's routing intentions at its directly
   connected hop points.  The incrementally deployable framework based
   on a universal verification primitive FC, is designed to be
   compatible with existing hop-by-hop forwarding architectures, while
   overcoming the limitations of current verification capabilities.  By
   utilizing chain-based validation, it establishes an end-to-end
   verification mechanism across Autonomous Systems (ASes), ensuring
   authenticity and operational validity of information across ASes.
   This strategy enables enhanced trust propagation across the global
   Internet while maintaining the existing hop-by-hop forwarding
   paradigm, providing a secure and compatible framework to address the
   security dilemmas caused by mismatch between verification scope and
   information propagation range.

2.  Role of FC in FC-based Framework

   The key element of FC-BGP security framework is a transferable
   universal verification primitive-Forwarding Commitment (FC).  The
   goal of FC is to achieve end-to-end verification within routing and
   forwarding system while maintaining compatibility with hop-by-hop
   processing paradigm.

       Figure 1: Integration of FC with Routing and Forwarding Path.

   The integration of FC with routing and forwarding path is shown in
   Figure 1.  During hop-by-hop processing, each AS generates an FC
   based on its routing intent.  The FC provides a verifiable proof
   through cryptographic signatures, encapsulating routing behavior
   committed at directly connected hop, including information about
   previous hop AS, current AS, next hop AS and IP prefix, ensuring the
   authenticity and trustworthiness of provided routing information.
   Subsequent AS receiving this information can verify FC from previous
   AS through a chain-based validation mechanism before appending its
   own FC information, ensuring authenticity and validity of
   information.  The design of chain-based validation ensures security
   of information during hop-by-hop propagation, preventing tampering by
   intermediate nodes or inconsistencies in policies from compromising
   end-to-end security.

   FC based on hop-by-hop verification mechanism, enables chain-based
   validation across multiple ASes.  Each FC generated by an AS can be
   independently verified without relying on updates from other ASes or
   cooperation from global network.  It also supports end-to-end
   verification across the entire network.  By constructing FC chains
   composed of multiple FCs between ASes, it can be used not only for
   individual hop-by-hop verification but also for building path chains
   that support global path validation, providing a foundation for end-
   to-end security.

   FC provides flexible propagation methods within FC-based framework,
   which can be achieved by extending existing BGP messages, proposing
   new propagation protocols, or leveraging existing network
   infrastructures such as RPKI for propagation.  This flexibility
   allows FC to be compatible with existing network infrastructures and
   enables gradual deployment and adoption.

+------------------------------------------------------------+/

                 Figure 2: Semantic Structure of FC.

   The uniqueness of FC-based framework lies in FCsemantic design, as
   shown in Figure 2, which encompasses two main types of information:
   topological information and operational information.  This design
   makes FC not just a supplement to existing security mechanisms, but a
   fundamental primitive that supports construction of comprehensive
   security frameworks.

   Topological Information: Topological information forms core of FC and
   is divided into two layers: 1.  Link Statement: FC expresses physical
   connections between ASes through a Link Statement, which records
   direct physical links such as fiber connections or dedicated lines.
   This information provides direct evidence of validity of BGP peering
   relationships.  If there is no physical connection between two ASes,
   they should not establish a BGP peering relationship.  The Link
   Statement ensures objectivity and verifiability of physical
   connections, eliminating routing announcements based on false
   connections.

   1.  BGP Peering: Based on physical connection states, FC further
       captures logical BGP peering relationships established over these
       connections.  By including previous hop, current AS, and next
       hop, FC describes inter-AS routing relationships in detail,
       enabling fine-grained, topology-based chained validation.  This
       helps verify whether an AS's routing announcement aligns with its
       BGP peering relationship, ensuring that AS has genuinely learned
       route information from a neighboring AS, preventing route
       hijacking attacks.

   Operational Information: FC encapsulates rich operational semantics
   that describe specific actions performed by an AS in routing and
   forwarding processes.  It maily includes the following:

   1.  Route Announcement: An AS announces its routing prefixes and path
       information to external peers.  FC can represent these route
       announcements within directly connected hop range and provide
       verifiable commitments to global network, helping prevent route
       hijacking.

   2.  Forwarding Path Designation: FC defines transmission path that
       packets should follow, which is critical for data plane security.
       By embedding forwarding path information, FC ensures that packets
       are forwarded as expected, preventing path manipulation or
       malicious redirection.

   3.  Routing Policy: FC captures the policies of an AS regarding how
       to select and propagate paths, ensuring the consistency of
       routing policies and helping to identify and prevent route leaks
       and configuration errors.

   By integrating topological and operational information, FC expresses
   behaviors ranging from AS level to global level.  Each FC represents
   routing and forwarding actions that occur within directly connected
   hop range, and by linking multiple FCs, chained validation can be
   achieved across scope of multiple ASes.  This mechanism ensures
   comprehensive verification of network operations, guaranteeing
   consistency and authenticity of information across entire network
   interaction range.

   In chain-based validation, FC is linked into a chain using
   cryptographic signatures, with each AS verifying the previous FC
   before appending its own information.  This creates a trust chain
   that spans multiple ASes.  This mechanism ensures end-to-end
   verification while maintaining decentralized nature of Internet.

   FC is compatible not only with existing BGP protocols but also
   supports future routing validation mechanisms, such as RPKI.  By
   leveraging FC as a foundational structure, it strengthens routing
   information and enhances security and reliability of network
   communication.

4.  Security Mechanisms Based on FC

   By introducing universal verification primitive FC, FC-based security
   framework combines independence of hop-by-hop forwarding with end-to-
   end security verification capability.  Below are some security
   mechanisms and application scenarios enabled by FC:

   1.  Routing Verification of Incremental Deployment: FC supports
       gradual deployment, allowing verification within networks that
       are not fully deployed.  Through hop-by-hop and chain-based
       verification, FC adapts to partial deployment scenarios, reducing
       overhead of global verification.

   2.  Consistency Between Control Plane and Data Plane: By combining
       BGP peering relationships with physical link information, FC
       significantly enhances data plane security.  For instance,
       embedding forwarding path information within FC ensures that
       packets are forwarded along expected routes, preventing path
       manipulation or malicious detours.

   3.  Route Leak Prevention and Policy Transparency: FC's operational
       information allows ASes to define and validate their routing
       policies, effectively preventing route leaks caused by
       misconfigurations or malicious policy violations.

   4.  Compatibility with Future Network Architectures: FC's universal
       structure remains compatible with both existing and future
       routing protocols, supporting emerging paradigms such as intent-
       based networking.

   5.  Dynamic Defense Mechanisms Against Emerging Attacks: FC's
       flexibility allows it to adjust to new attack scenarios,
       dynamically optimizing granularity of FC information to address
       evolving security challenges.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Security Guarantees

   When FC-BGP used in conjunction with origin validation, the following
   security guarantees can be achieved:

   1.  The source AS in a route announcement is authorized.

   2.  FC-BGP speakers on the AS-Path are authorized to propagate the
       route announcements.

   3.  The forwarding path of packets is consistent with the routing
       path announced by the FC-BGP speakers.

   FC-BGP is designed to enhance the security of control plane routing
   and dataplane forwarding in the Internet at the network layer.
   Specifically, FC-BGP allows an AS to independently prove its BGP
   routing decisions with publicly verifiable cryptography commitments,
   based on which any on-path AS can verify the authenticity of a BGP
   path; meanwhile FC-BGP ensures the consistency between the control
   plane and dataplane, i.e., the network traffic shall take the
   forwarding path that is consistent with the control plane routing
   decisions, or otherwise be discarded.  More crucially, the above
   security guarantees offered by FC-BGP are not binary, i.e., secure or
   non-secure.  Instead, the security benefits are strictly
   monotonically increasing as the deployment rate of FC-BGP (i.e., the
   percentage of ASes that are upgraded to support FC-BGP) increases.
